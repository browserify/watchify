# 5.0.0

At a glance:

* extensible internal labeled-stream-splicer pipeline
* bundle() - no longer accepts `opts`, callback gets a buffer 
* b.deps(), b.pack(), opts.pack, opts.deps are gone
* can call bundle() multiple times on the same instance
* a better --noparse matcher
* id labeling integer index based instead of hash based
* derequire removed for performance reasons
* .external(bundle) has been removed (for now)
* semicolon at end of output
* hashing is gone so `expose: true` or explicit expose id is required for doing
multi-export bundles

# 4.2.3

reverts 4.2.2 due to breaking some existing use-cases

# 4.2.2

fixes a bug applying transforms to symlinked files by resolving the realpath
first https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/pull/831

# 4.2.1

SECURITY NOTICE

Make sure your installation of browserify is using syntax-error@1.1.1 or
later. there was a security vulnerability where a malicious file could
execute code when browserified.

The vulnerability involves breaking out of `Function()`, which was used to
check syntax for more informative errors. In node 0.10, `Function()` seems
to be implemented in terms of `eval()`, so malicious code can execute even
if the function returned by `Function()` was never called. node 0.11 does
not appear to be vulnerable.
